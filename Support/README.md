Scenario 1: Web Automation

To perform this automation testing, I used Cypress as a testing tool.

#Project Setup
1. Install node.js
2. Install Visual Studio Code
3. Open the "Source Code" folder in Visual Studio Code
4. Open terminal in Visual Studio Code
5. Run the command "npm init"
6. Run the command "npx cypress install"
7. Run the command "npx cypress run"

Other Features:
1. A test report will be automatically generated inside the reports folder
2. Video files of all test runs will be automatically populated inside the reports folder
3. Screenshots will be automatically taken if any test case fails during the test run inside the screenshots folder
